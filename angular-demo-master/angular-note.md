The @angular/material package provides the components of the Material Design, @angular/cdk is a component development kit that is needed for the Material components to work and hammerjs is a library that provides smooth animations for the component. @angular/flex-layout provides a flexible and responsive grid. It is independent of the Material components but is often used together with it.

ng add @angular/material
npm i @angular/flex-layout
npm i hammerjs

Error: Angular JIT compilation failed: '@angular/compiler' not loaded!
  - JIT compilation is discouraged for production use-cases! Consider AOT mode instead.
  Solution:
  Turn off the AOT by changing "aot": true to "aot: false in angular.json file. I would not recommend this as this improves the performance of the Angular app and improves the catching of error codes in development mode.
